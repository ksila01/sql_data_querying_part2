### Project Overview
Part 2 of the Maji Ndogo project expands the in-depth SQL analysis to further address the city's water crisis. This phase focuses on a detailed exploration of the dataset, examining water source types, employee activities, population distribution, and queue time analysis. Maji Ndogo faces significant challenges with water accessibility, prompting this project to leverage SQL analysis to uncover impactful solutions. The dataset, compiled from multiple sources, serves as the foundation for our investigation, allowing us to explore key factors affecting water access and distribution in the region.

### Queries and Analysis
#### SQL Sample Query
* Step-by-step breakdown of crucial SQL queries used in this section.
* Queries encompass various data analyses, population assessments, water source evaluations, and employee-related investigations.

### Integrated Project Questions:(see answers on jupyter notebook)
1. Which SQL query will produce the date format "DD Month YYYY" from the time_of_record column in the visits table as a single column?
2. You are working with an SQL query designed to calculate the Annual Rate of Change (ARC) for basic rural water services. To accomplish this task, what should you use for placeholders (a) and (b) in the query?
3.  What are the names of the two worst-performing employees who visited the fewest sites, and how many sites did the worst-performing employee visit? Modify your queries from the “Honouring the workers” section.
4.   If we TRIM() the address '33 Angelique Kidjo Avenue ' for an employee named Farai Nia, what would be the result
5.   How many employees live in Dahabu? Rely on one of the queries we used in the project to answer this.
6.   How many employees live in Harare, Kilimani?
7. On average, how many people share a well? Round your answer to 0 decimals.
8. Consider the query we used to calculate the total number of people served. Which line of code will calculate the total number of people using some sort of tap?
9. Use the pivot table we created to determine the average queue times for the following times: Saturday from 12:00 to 13:00, Tuesday from 18:00 to 19:00, and Sunday from 09:00 to 10:00.
